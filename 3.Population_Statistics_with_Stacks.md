# Population Statistics with Stacks

[Setup Stacks](#setup-stacks) \
[Input files](#input-files) \
[populations command](#populations-command) \
[populations output](#populations-output) 

## Setup Stacks 

Download here: https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/ \
Install instructions here: https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/manual/#install

OR

use conda to install:

In terminal:

 	conda create --name <my-env> #agree to proceed with "y"
  	conda install bioconda::stacks
    
Commands are run through terminal from the stacks program directory when on the lab Desktop:

    cd ~/Desktop/stacks-2.60

Or if you have a stacks conda environment installed:

    conda activate stacks-2.68
    
Test that stacks is working properly, if it is, this next line will give you the usage instructions for `populations` command in stacks

    populations --h

## Input files:

Before we start running things, we need two input files and the path of where they live. 
1) **the vcf file** (output from stacks) \
Go to the directory where your .vcf file is and `pwd` to get the correct path 
2) **population codes** file for the files included in the vcf \
The pop_codes.csv file should be 2 columns; the name of the files without the file ending (.fastq.gz etc) which you can take from the final stats file in ipyrad outfiles and the site names

`NAME_stacks_pop_codes.csv`

		file_name1	pop_code1
		file_name2	pop_code1
		file_name3	pop_code1
		file_name4	pop_code2
		file_name5	pop_code2
		file_name6	pop_code2
		file_name7	pop_code3
		file_name8	pop_code3
		file_name9	pop_code3
		

### populations command
You can `populations -h` to see usage / all the possible flags/parameters for the `populations` command and their explanations.
Plug in the correct paths for your vcf, output directory, and pop_codes.csv.

	populations -V PATH/TO/VCF.vcf -O PATH/TO/OUTPUT/DIRECTORY -M PATH/TO/POP_CODES.csv --fstats --write_random_snp --min_populations 1 -r 0.2

### populations output 
There are a ton of output files but the ones you really want to look at are the three *_summary.tsv files:

	ls -lh *_summary.tsv

Which lists:

	-rw-r--r--  1 kristenlehman  staff   716B Oct  4 11:09 CatalinaSIFI.p.fst_summary.tsv
	-rw-r--r--  1 kristenlehman  staff   1.5K Oct  4 11:09 CatalinaSIFI.p.phistats_summary.tsv
	-rw-r--r--  1 kristenlehman  staff   5.0K Oct  4 11:09 CatalinaSIFI.p.sumstats_summary.tsv

https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/manual/#pfiles gives tables of names for the stats columns headers to all output files.
