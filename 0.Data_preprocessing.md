## Renaming files using a loop: adding a prefix to differentiate same sample-different run

We had some rough sequences from plate 1, 2, and so we resequenced some of those individuals in plate 3. The first run of plate 3 had low output and has to be rerun again. This means, for some samples, we have up to 3 sequences that will need to be merged. Some with different file neames (between plates 1,2,and 3) and some with the exact same name. To make things easier down the line when we get the 2nd run of plate 3 back with the extact same name, I am adding a prefix to the files from the first run of plate3.

In this example all the files in a directory need this renaming treatment. If we `ls` it returns the lis of files in the directory:

        Sibara_filifolia_SNK126_9614_SCa_Bunkers2	
        Sibara_filifolia_HES_SIFI126_Bunkers2_9614
        Sibara_filifolia_KMM57_9553_SCa_WBG3	        
        Sibara_filifolia_KMM_SIFI57_9553
        Sibara_filifolia_KMM62_9558_SCa_WBG5	        
        Sibara_filifolia_KMM_SIFI62_9558

To add the prefix "pl3a" to all files in the directory, we'll use a for loop:

    for file in *.fastq.gz; 
    do
    mv $file ./"pl3a_""$file"; 
    done

## Merging sample files by shared extraction number
You could make a list of the extraction numbers and then make a for loop to do this but with only ~8 merges to do I figured doing them one by one would overall be faster. 

First I moved all the files meeding merging into a directory I made called `merg_room`, again if you had a quick list of the extraction numbers a loop would be great for this.

    mv *extraction#* /merg_room

Then for each pair of files that share an extraction #:

    cat *extraction#* > New_name  # I just took the name of one of the files and added "cat" just after the extraction number

## Renaming files for consistency so we can code our sequence choice based on site
In order to more easily pick out the correct sequence files based on their sites/islands, I am renaming many of my sequneces since that info was not included on many of them or were not particularly standardized. I just made a simple bash code using a combination of excel (`=concat(mv,old_file_name_,new_filename)) and pasted the column into a code that looks like this (I didn't include all the lines). 

`rename_seq.sh`

    #!/bin/bash
    mv Sibara_filifolia_KAASIFI24_9496.fastq.gz Sibara_filifolia_KAA_SIFI24_9496_SCa_WBG4.fastq.gz
    mv Sibara_filifolia_KAASIFI25_9497.fastq.gz Sibara_filifolia_KAA_SIFI25_9497_SCa_WBG4.fastq.gz
    mv Sibara_filifolia_KAASIFI26_9498.fastq.gz Sibara_filifolia_KAA_SIFI26_9498_SCa_WBG4.fastq.gz

Then, in terminal, have this `rename_seq.sh` code in the directory with the sequences (or just write in the path to the directory with the sequences). You should also do a test run with just a few sequences to make sure it's working as expected. 

    bash rename_seq.sh

Now all my sequences have the island code (either SCa_or SCl_) plus the sampling site code or name at the end of the file name. 

From here, when we make our params- file we can easily code in `*_SCa_*` or `*_SCl_*` in the line where we direct ipyrad where the raw data is.
