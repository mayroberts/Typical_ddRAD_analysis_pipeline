# File naming 
If you follow a consistent and informative naming convention for your project, you will save yourself or labmates hours - even days of tedious work. This is especially important for large smaple projects. 

Here is a file name that has all the info we may need:

`Genus_species_libraryplate#_extraction#_collector-initials-and-number_Site-name`

example: Sibara_filifolia_pl1_KMM62_9558_SCa_WBG5.fastq.gz
