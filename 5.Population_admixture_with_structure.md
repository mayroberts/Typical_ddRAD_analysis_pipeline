# Population admixture with STRUCTURE

### Input files
To run Structure you need 2 input files: 1) the `.snps.hdf5` file (from ipyrad output files) and 2) a population file  

The population file should look like this:

      imap = {
          "Pop_name1": ["indiv_name1", "indivi_name2","indiv_name3","indiv_name4","indiv_name5","indiv_name6",],
          "pop_name2": ["indiv_name7, indiv_name8", "indiv_name9","indiv_name10","indiv_name11","indiv_name12","indiv_name13","indiv_name14"],
          "pop_name3": ["indiv_name15", "indiv_name16","indiv_name17","indiv_name18","indiv_name19","indiv_name20","indiv_name21","indiv_name22"]
          }

In terminal
